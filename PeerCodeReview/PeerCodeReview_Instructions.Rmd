# Assignment Overview

For this assignment, you will conduct a formal **peer code review** of another student’s final project hosted on GitHub. You will assess code for clarity, functionality, organization, and reproducibility, and provide **constructive, actionable feedback**.

The majority of your code review will occur on GitHub (follow the instructions below). In addition, you will submit a knitted PDF file with a completed checklist and reflection to D2L.

**Total Points**: 100 **Due Date**: Sunday, May 11 at midnight MST

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment Instructions

## 1. Access Your Assigned Peer’s GitHub Repository *(5 points)*

-   Go to your peer's GitHub repository.
-   Fork and clone the repository to your computer (see detailed instructions below).
-   Review the README and folder structure before diving into code.

## 2. Review Code and Comment on GitHub *(75 points total)*

Leave **specific, respectful, and helpful** comments directly on GitHub. Your comments should address:

| Area | Description | Points |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Clarity & Readability | Are variable names clear? Is the code easy to follow? | 15 |
| Functionality | Does the code run correctly? Are outputs as expected? | 15 |
| Code Organization | Are scripts and files structured logically? | 15 |
| Documentation | Is the README useful? Are scripts well-commented? | 15 |
| Suggestions for Improvement | Provide 3+ specific, actionable suggestions. | 15 |

-   Leave at least **8 inline comments** across the project.
-   Be specific. For [[example:\\\\](example:\\){.uri}]([example:\\](example:\){.uri}){.uri} *“Consider renaming this function to clarify its purpose."*\
    is better than *“This is confusing.”*

## 3. Submit the Checklist and Reflection to D2L *(20 points)*

In the checklist and reflection .Rmd file, write 7-10 sentences summarizing your review experience:

-   What was done well?
-   What was challenging about this assignment?
-   What did you learn for your own projects?
-   How did you approach constructive feedback?

Upload the knitted `.pdf` file to the "Peer Code Review" Assignment on D2L.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for GitHub Peer Code Review

Follow these six steps to complete your peer code review using GitHub. This process uses a **fork-based workflow**. You will fork your peer’s repository, add review comments in your fork, and submit a draft pull request with your feedback.

---

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Go to your assigned peer’s GitHub repository.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of their repository under your GitHub account.
3. On your forked copy, click the green **Code** button and copy the URL.
4. Open RStudio and use the URL to clone the repository to your computer:
   - In RStudio: Go to *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*, paste the URL, and choose a folder.

---

### Step 2: Add Comments to the Code

You should leave at least **eight comments** during your review.

1. Open the cloned project.
2. Leave review notes using comments (for example, lines that begin with “REVIEW:”).
3. Save the files after adding your comments.

---

### Step 3: Commit and Push Your Changes

1. Save your commented files.
2. In RStudio:
   - Use the Git pane to stage and commit the changes.
   - Write a brief commit message like “Peer review comments.”
   - Push the changes to your forked GitHub repository.

---

### Step 4: Create a Pull Request to Submit Your Review

1. Go to your **forked repository** on GitHub.
2. Click the "Contribute" or "Pull request" button.
3. Make sure the pull request is targeted **from your fork** to your peer’s **original repository**.
4. Confirm that:
   - The base repository is your peer’s (e.g., `peerusername/project`).
   - The head repository is your fork (e.g., `yourusername/project`).
5. Write a short summary of your review in the pull request description.
6. Click **“Create pull request.”**

**Important:** You are submitting comments and suggestions only. Do not merge the pull request.

---

### Step 5: Complete the Peer Review Checklist

1. Review the Peer Code Review Checklist provided in this assignment.
2. Check off each item as you complete it.
3. Provide brief notes where indicated.

---

### Step 6: Write and Submit Your Reflection

1. Write a reflection of 7-10 sentences addressing the following:
   - What was done well in the code?
   - What could be improved?
   - What did you learn from reviewing this project?
   - How might this influence how you approach your own coding?
2. Submit your completed checklist and reflection to the course LMS.
