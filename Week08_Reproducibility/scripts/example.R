# This is an R script. 

## What does that mean? ##

# It is a document that only understands R code, so anything I write that isn't 
# in the language R (such as what I'm writing right now), has to have a # in front
# of it to be ignored.
# The file ending for R scripts is .R

## How does this differ from an RMarkdown or Quarto file? ##

# Because Quarto files combine text with code, we have to specify when the file 
# should interpret what we are typing as the R language; these are the code chunks.
# Since this document only understands the R language, we don't need code chunks...
# and there is no "visual" mode.

# You can think of this document as basically one giant code chunk!
# You can still run lines of code with `Ctrl` + `Enter` or `Cmd` + `Return`
