# Binds and Joins

In today's lesson, we will be talking about how to bring multiple dataframes together into one data frame.

Often times, we have a lot of data for one project that are related but storing all of the data in one file would add unnecessary redundancy (e.g., data in certain rows would need to be repeated too often). Other times, data has been collected separately and needs to be combined before analysis.

Being able to join together data from related tables is a key skill in data science, and for working with larger data structures (databases with their own languages, like SQL).

## Binds vs. Joins

We have 2 main methods of combining datasets: binds and joins. They work in different ways.

### Binds

One way we can combine data sets in through binds. Binds act similarly to gluing datasets together.

They don't match up data based on unique identifiers; instead they match up data by column name (`bind_rows`) or row position (`bind_cols`). 

![](binds.png)
These can be very useful, but you need to be careful using them, especially `bind_cols`, as the function will automatically assume that the rows are in the correct positions.

Let's work with an example.

The `surveys` data only goes through 2002, but we have a lot more data from the site! Let's pull down all of the rodent data since 2002 from the `portalr` package, a package we made to make working with the (actual) Portal data a bit easier
```{r}
# load our packages
library(portalr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# read in the surveys df
surveys <- read_csv("surveys.csv")

# load the new rodent data and do a little cleaning
new_rodents <- summarize_individual_rodents() %>% 
  select(month, day, year, plot_id = plot, species_id = species, sex, hindfoot_length = hfl, weight = wgt) %>% 
  filter(year > 2002) %>% 
  mutate(record_id = seq(nrow(surveys) + 1, nrow(surveys) + nrow(.)))
```

When we look at the `new_rodents` data frame, we can see the same columns as in `surveys`, though the `record_id` column is at the end.

We want to bind these two dataframes together so that we have _all_ of the rodent data in one dataframe. To do so, we would use `bind_rows()`. Even though columns are getting matched up, the things we are binding together are multiple rows, hence `bind_rows()`.

The arguments for both `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` are the names of the dataframes you want to bind together.

```{r}
all_rodents <- bind_rows(surveys, new_rodents)

head(all_rodents)
tail(all_rodents)
```


## Joins

### Multiple Data Tables

When we talked about data structure, one of the things we discussed was splitting data into multiple tables. This lets us avoid unnecessary redundant information, like listing the full taxonomy for every individual of a species. This, in turn, makes storage more efficient and allows us to make changes in one place, not hundreds of places.

Our goal is for each table to contain a single kind of information.

Let’s look at this in the Portal dataset.

```{r}
# surveys <- read_csv("surveys.csv")
species <- read_csv("species.csv")
plots <- read_csv("plots.csv")
```

In the Portal dataset:

-   `surveys`: information about individuals
-   `species`: information about species
-   `plots`: information about plots

This way, if a species name changes (for example), we only need to change it in the species table rather than tens of thousands of times.

### How Joins Work

Joins are arguably the more complicated of the two types of ways to combine data, but they are, therefore, the more flexible and useful.

The magic of comes comes because they _match up columns of data based on unique identifiers in each row of data_.

In the following diagram, the two example data frames have the column `x1` in common, and each of the values in `x1` are unique (no repeats in the same data frame). When combining the datasets, all of the columns are added, and their rows are matched up to their respective values in the `x1` column.

This can happen a couple ways, depending on which data frame is the reference and how much data you want to retain.

![](joins.png)

To enable us to make these connections the tables need one (or more) columns that link them together.

In the case of the Portal data, there is one column that links the `surveys` and `species` tables: `species_id`
There is also one column that links the `surveys` and `plots` tables: plot_id

Let’s join the surveys and the species tables together using an “inner join.”

To do this we use the inner_join function from `dplyr`. It takes three arguments:

1) The first of the two tables we want to join
2) The second of the two tables we want to join
3) The column, or columns, that provide the linkage between the two tables

```{r}
combined <- inner_join(surveys, species, join_by(species_id))
combined
```

Looking at the combined table, we can see that on every row with a particular value for `species_id`, the join has added the matching values on `genus`, `species`, and `taxa`.

One way to think about this join is that it adds the relevant information in the species table to the surveys table. Often for scientific data we can think about there being one main table, the surveys table in our case, and multiple supplementary tables that provide additional details.

Inner joins keep information from both tables when both tables have a matching value in the join column.

Let's go back up and look at the visualization of the inner join. When we use the `inner_join` function to merge together table a and b, the result only has rows for which the common column (`x1`) have the same values in each table (A and B).

Translating this to the rodent data, that means that we dropped any rows for which there is no matching `species_id`.

Scroll to Line 324 in the `surveys` table; these have missing species IDs. If you look in the `combined` table, ou'll notice that `record_id`, 324-326 are missing from the table.

The other join functions might have handled this differently, based on how they work.

For example, feft joins keep all rows in the first, or left, table. If we wanted to keep rows with missing species IDs in the `surveys` data frame, we could use `left_join()`.

```{r}
combined <- left_join(surveys, species, join_by(species_id))
```

There are also right joins, which keep all rows in the second, or right, table
And full joins, which keep all rows from both tables
For our exercises we’ll focus on using inner joins
Multi-table join
But we often need to combine more than two tables
To join more than two tables we start by joining two tables
And then join the resulting table to a third table, and so on
So, for Portal, we could start by joining the surveys and the species tables and then combine the resulting table with the plots table
full_data <- surveys |>
  inner_join(species, join_by(species_id)) |>
  inner_join(plots, join_by(plot_id))
Do Portal Data Joins.
