# Aggregation

## Setup

First, we need to load out packages that we will be using for our lesson. Again, we will need `readr` and `dplyr`.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

Next, we will download our Portal files.

```{r}
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172", "surveys.csv")
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474", "plots.csv")
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483", "species.csv")
download.file("http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/data/shrub-volume-data.csv", "shrub-volume-data.csv")
```

Basic aggregation
surveys <- read.csv("surveys.csv")
Aggregation combines rows into groups based on one of more columns.
Calculates combined values for each group.
First step, group the data frame.
Let’s group it by year
group_by
Arguments: 1) table to work on; 2) columns to group by
group_by(surveys, year)
Different looking kind of data.frame
Called a tibble
Sometimes produced by dplyr functions
Source, grouping, and data type information
Store the data frame in a variable to use in the next step
surveys_by_year <- group_by(surveys, year)
After grouping a data frame use summarize() to calculate values for each group.
Count the number of rows for each group (individuals in each species).
summarize
Arguments
Table to work on, which needs to be a grouped table
One additional argument for each calculation we want to do for each group
New column name to store calculated value
=
Calculation that we want to perform for each group
We’ll use the function n which is a special function that counts the rows in the table
counts_by_year <- summarize(surveys_by_year, abundance = n())
Can group by multiple columns
Count the number of individuals in each plot in each year
surveys_by_plot_year <- group_by(surveys, plot_id, year)
counts_by_plot_year <- summarize(surveys_by_plot_year, abundance = n())
Just like with other dplyr functions we could write this using pipes instead
plot_year_counts <- surveys |>
  group_by(plot_id, year) |>
  summarize(abundance = n())
Do Portal Data Aggregation 1-2.

We can also do multiple calculations using summarize
Use any function that returns a single value from a vector.
E.g., mean, max, min
We’ll calculate the number of individuals in each plot year combination and their average weight
size_abundance_data <- surveys |>
  group_by(plot_id, year) |>
  summarize(abundance = n(), avg_weight = mean(weight))
Open table
Why did we get NA?
mean(weight) returns NA when weight has missing values (NA)
Can fix using mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
size_abundance_data <- surveys |>
  group_by(plot_id, year) |>
  summarize(abundance = n(),
            avg_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
Still has NaN for cases where no individuals have a weight
Can filter using !is.na
size_abundance_data <- surveys |>
  group_by(plot_id, year) |>
  summarize(abundance = n(),
            avg_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  filter(!is.na(avg_weight))
Also note the message about “grouped output”
It says that the resulting data frame is grouped by year
When we group by more than one column the resulting data frame is grouped by all but the last group
Can be useful in some more complicated circumstances
Can also make things not work if functions don’t support grouped data frames
We can remove these groups by add ungroup() to the end of our pipeline
size_abundance_data <- surveys |>
  group_by(plot_id, year) |>
  summarize(abundance = n(),
            avg_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  filter(!is.na(avg_weight)) |>
  ungroup()
The message still prints because it happens as part of the summarize step
But looking at the resulting data frame
size_abundance_data
Shows us that the final data frame is ungrouped
