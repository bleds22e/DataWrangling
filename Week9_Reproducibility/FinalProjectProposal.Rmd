## Where to Find Data

If you have your own data from a research project, use it!

If you don't have your own data, here are some suggestions for where to find data:

1.    From your lab group

If you are working in a lab group, you can almost certainly find data to work with from your lab! Ask your PI or other lab members if you can use their data for this project. It is often helpful to have data that relates somewhat to a project or topic you are familiar with.

2.    From me (actually from the National Phenology Network)!

I currently have a project helping the National Phenology Network take data collected by communitiy members and cleaning it up so it can be integrated into the NPN database.

If you choose to work with one of these datasets, I can give you some guidance on what the end product should look like.

You can find a list of the dataset options [here](https://archive.usanpn.org/results/dataset-list).

3.    From the "Data is Plural" Archive

[Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) is a weekly newsletter about complied datasets that people have found. They have an archive of all of the datasets that have been included in the newsletters, which is nearly 2000. 

Just because the datasets have been compiled does not mean that they are clean! I've used a few of them in class as demonstrations.

2.    From an agency, NGO, or non-profit

If you have contacts in a local, state, or federal agency or non-profit, they likely have some languishing data floating around that you can clean up.
