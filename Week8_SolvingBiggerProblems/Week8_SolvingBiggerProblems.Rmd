# Solving Bigger Problems

This week, we are going to take a break learning commands to talk about
general approaches to programming.

Real computational tasks tend to be complicated. To accomplish them, you
need to **think before you code**.

## Set Up

For this lesson and the assignment, we will be using a number of
datasets, including the 3 datasets with Portal data that we are already
somewhat familiar with.

Let's read in the `tidyverse` and download our datasets to get started.

```{r}
# packages
library(tidyverse)

# data
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172",
  "surveys.csv")
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474",
  "plots.csv")
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483",
  "species.csv")
download.file("https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/data/mammal-size-data-clean.tsv",
  "mammal-size-data-clean.txt")
```

## Problem Decomposition steps

One great way to work through the steps of coding is to break down the
problem into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can also help you get
an idea of the order in which to approach the coding.

Here are some good guidelines:

1.  Understand the problem
    a.  Restate the problem in your own words
    b.  Determine the inputs and outputs
    c.  Ask for clarification
2.  Break the problem down
    a.  Write down the pieces, on paper or as comments in a file
    b.  Break complicated pieces down until all pieces are small and
        manageable
3.  Code one small piece at a time
    a.  Test it on it's own
    b.  Fix any problems before proceeding

### Let's Practice!

Take a look at Question 4 in the assignment. Spend a few minutes reading
through the question, restate the question in your on words, and then
break down the steps.

### Iteration

As you've probably discovered by now, programming requires a lot of
iteration to get to code to do exactly what you want it to do and
produce the output you are looking for.

When writing more and more complex code, it can help to start simple and
build the code up.

> Write a simple version -\> Make sure it works -\> Make sure you
> understand it -\> Modify it to make it more complicated -\> Repeat
> until finished

Perhaps we want to calculate the average hindfoot length in cm for each
rodent species at Portal.

Let's start by breaking down the problem. Then, we can add one piece at a time

```{r}
# join species and surveys data
# filter for rodent species only
# convert hindfoot length to cm
# group data by species
# summary data of hindfoot length

surveys <- read_csv("surveys.csv")
species <- read_csv("species.csv")

avg_rodent_hf_cm <- surveys %>% 
  inner_join(species, join_by(species_id)) %>% 
  filter(taxa == "Rodent") %>% 
  mutate(hindfoot_cm = hindfoot_length / 10) %>% 
  group_by(species_id) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hf = mean(hindfoot_cm, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Debugging

A major part of the iterative process of coding is fixing errors that
come up! You've already had quite a bit of practice with this working on
your assignments, but let's talk about some general strategies together.

1.  Be a scientist.

-   Hypothesize about what is wrong.
-   Make one change that is expected to fix error.
-   Check if change worked/fixed error.

2.  **Do not change something without a reason.**

Develop hypotheses!
-   See where the code failed.
-   Read the error message.
-   Observe what the code is doing.
    -   Look at the current state of the environment. This gives you
        a current snapshot of what is going on
    -   Talk through the code
    -   [Rubber duck
            programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

3.  Run the code line by line checking each step.
4.  Use generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT)

### Example

Below, we have a code chunk with some code that is mean to summarize
some of the Portal data and then plot it. However, as you'll see when
you try to run the code, we have some errors.

First, copy the code into a new code chunk below. Spend a few minutes working through this code chunk to debug it. Utilize
some of the strategies above.

Code chunk to debug: leave as is for reference.

```{r eval=FALSE}
surveys <- read_csv('surveys.csv')
species <- read_csv('species.csv')

do_counts_by_year <- survey %>% 
  filter(species = "DO") %>% 
  group_by(year)
  summarize(count = n())

ggplot(do_count_by_year, aes(x = year, y = count)) %>% 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw()
```

Insert a code chunk here. Copy the code from above and work to debug it.

Now, let's copy the code into ChatGPT and see what it finds and what it
gets wrong.

## Finding Help

In this class, I've provided the instructor versions of the lessons in
class for you to have a reference sheets. They are super helpful, but
they won't always have exactly what you need, especially when you are
working with your own datasets.

The good news is that there is help! In fact, professional programmers
use Google regularly; I am constantly googling how to acheive certain
tasks, including for the lessons and assignments in this class!

There is a bit of an art to learning how to search, read, and apply
online help. Let's talk through a few tips that you might find helpful.

### In the Search:

-   Get the vocabulary right
-   Avoid extra words
-   Specify the programming language (and specify `tidyverse` if that
    matters to you)

### Results:

**Help sites**

-   Read the question
-   Look at the setup
-   Check the age (when was it answered?)
-   Check the top 2-3 answers
-   Glance at the comments
-   Test & modify the example
    -   But don't blindly paste things you don't understand
    -   Reputation can help - e.g., StackOverflow w/lots of positive
        votes

**Blog posts**

-   Read the question
-   Look at the setup
-   Use `Find` (`Ctrl` + `F` or `Cmd` + `F`)

**Documentation**

-   Use `Find` (`Ctrl` + `F` or `Cmd` + `F`)
-   Focus on the examples

### Testing and modifying answers

Often, we won't be able to tell right away if the code provided in the
answer will work for our specific data or situation. We always need to
test it out.

First, if given a reproducible examples (reprex), meaning is has data
and code you can copy and paste to run, do so! This can help with
understanding what the code is doing and whether or not it will work in
your case.

From there, you can begin to modify the example to include your data and
specific values.
