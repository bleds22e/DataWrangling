## Quarto

This document is a test to see if Quarto files have the same working directory behavior as RMarkdown files or as R scripts.

```{r}
read.csv("../data_raw/adelie.csv")
```

```{r}
read.csv("Week09_Reproducibility/data_raw/adelie.csv")
```

They seem to behave like RMarkdown files, meaning their saved location is their working directory.
