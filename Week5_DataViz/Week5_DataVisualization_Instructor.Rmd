# Data Visualization

### Introduction to the UHURU dataset

### Data

-   For the next set of lessons we'll be working with data on acacia size from an experiment in Kenya
-   The experiment is designed to understand the influence of herbivores on vegetation by excluding different sized herbivores
-   There are 3 different treatments:
    -   The top-left image shows Megaherbivore exclosures, which use wires 2m high to keep elephants
    -   The top-right image shows Mesoherbivore exclosures, which use fenses starting 1/3m off the ground to exclude things like impalla
    -   The bottom-left image shows full exclosures, which use fences all the way to the ground to keep out all mammalian herbivores
    -   And the bottom-right image shows control plots

![Pictures of 4 experimental treatments. (A) Megaherbivore fences consist of two parallel wires starting 2-m above ground level. (B) Mesoherbivore fences consist of 11 parallel wires starting \~0.3 m above ground level and continuing to 2.4-m above ground level. (C) Total-exclusion fences consist of 14 wires up to 2.4-m above ground level, with a 1-m high chain-link barrier at ground level. (D) Open control plots are unfenced, with boundaries demarcated by short wooden posts at 10-m intervals.](https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/064/images/Fig2.png)

-   So far we've been working with datasets that are separated by commas
-   *Click on surveys.csv to show csv format*
-   But if we look at this new dataset it looks different
-   
    -   *Click on Acacia Dataset to Open in Text Editor*
-   This data is tab separated, so we'll need to treat it differently when we import it
-   To do this we manually set the character separating each column using the optional `sep` argument
-   So we'll call our data frame `acacia` and assign it the output from `read.csv`
-   We still give it the name of the file in quotes as the first argument
-   Then we add a comma and `sep = "\t"`
-   `\t` is who we indicate a Tab character in programming

```{r}
acacia <- read_tsv("ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt")
```

-   We can also see that it includes information on whether or not the plant is dead in the HEIGHT column
-   Is that good data structure?
-   If you said "No", you're right, information on if the tree is dead should be stored in a separate column
-   For now, we'll just treat the "dead" entries as null values
-   We can do this by using another optional argument `na.strings`
-   So let's modify our `read.csv` statement by adding `na.strings = c("dead")`.
-   This will replace the string `"dead"` with `NA`
-   It gets passed as a vector because this allows multiple different values to be set as nulls

```{r}
acacia <- read_tsv("ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt", na = c("", "dead"))
```

-   If we open the resulting table we can see that it includes information on:
    -   the time and location of the sampling
    -   the experimental treatment
    -   the size of each Acacia including a height, the canopy diameter measured in the direction (or axis) or the largest diameter and the diameter of the axis perpendicular to that, and the circumference of the shrub
    -   information on the number of flowers, buds, and fruits
    -   And finally information on the species of ant associated with the shrub because there is a very interesting ant-acacia mutualism where the Acacia special structures that serve as houses for the ants and the ants swarm herbivores that try to eat the acacia

### ggplot

-   Very popular plotting package
-   Good plots quickly
-   Declarative - describe what you want not how to build it
-   Contrasts w/Imperative - how to build it step by step
-   Install `ggplot2` using `install.packages`

### Basics

-   We load the `ggplot2` package just like we loaded `dplyr`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

-   To build a plot using `ggplot` we start with the `ggplot()` function

```{r}
ggplot()
```

-   `ggplot()` creates a base ggplot object that we can then add things to

-   Like a blank canvas

-   We can also add optional arguments for information to be shared across different components of the plot

-   The two main arguments we typically use here are

-   `data` - which is the name of the data frame we are working with, so `acacia`

-   `mapping` - which describes which columns of the data are used for different aspects of the plot

-   We create a `mapping` by using the `aes` function, which stands for "aesthetic", and then linking columns to pieces of the plot

-   We'll start with telling ggplot what value should be on the x and y axes

-   Let's plot the relationship betwen the circumference of an acacia and its height

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT))
```

-   This still doesn't create a figure, it's just a blank canvas and some information on default values for data and mapping columns to pieces of the plot
-   We can add data to the plot using layers
-   We do this by adding a `+` after the the `ggplot` function and then adding something called a `geom`, which stands for `geometry`
-   To make a scatter plot we use `geom_point`

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point()
```

-   It is standard to hit `Enter` after the plus so that each layer shows up on its own line

-   To change things about the layer we can pass additional arguments to the `geom`

-   We can do things like change

    -   the `size` of the points, we'll set it to `3`
    -   the `color` of the points, we'll set it to `"blue"`
    -   the transparency of the points, which is called `alpha`, we'll set it to 0.5

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue", alpha = 0.5)
```

-   To add labels (like documentation for your graphs!) we use the `labs` function

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Circumference [cm]", y = "Height [m]",
       title = "Acacia Survey at UHURU")
```

### Rescaling axes

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

-   Not changing the data itself, just the presentation of it

### Grouping

-   Group on a single graph
-   Look at influence of experimental treatment

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5)
```

-   Facet specification

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~TREATMENT)
```

-   Where are all the acacia in the open plots? (eaten?)

### Statistical transformations

-   We've seen that ggplot makes graphs by combining information on
    -   Data
    -   Mapping of parts of that data to aspects of the plot
    -   A geometric object to represent the data

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point()
```

-   Many kinds of geometric object (type `geom_` and show completions)

-   Each geom includes a statistical transformations

-   So far we've only seen

    -   `identity`: the raw form of the data or no transformation

-   Transformations exist to make things like histograms, bar plots, etc.

-   Occur as defaults in associated geoms

-   To look at the number of acacia in each treatment use a bar plot

    -   [`geom_bar()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html)

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_bar()
```

-   Uses the transformation `stat_count()`
    -   Counts the number of rows for each treatment
-   To look at the distribution of circumferences in the dataset use a histogram
    -   [`geom_histogram()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html)

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "red")
```

-   Uses `stat_bins()` for data transformation
    -   Splits circumferences into bins and counts rows in each bin
-   Set number of `bins` or `binwidth`

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "red", bins = 15)
```

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "red", binwidth = 5)
```

-   These can be combined with all of the other `ggplot2` features we've learned

> Do Tasks 1-2 in [Acacia and ants histograms](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/exercises/Graphing-acacia-ants-histograms-R).

### Position

-   geom's also come with a default position
-   In many cases the position is `"identity"`, which just means the object is plotted in the position determined by the data, but not always
-   Let's remake our histogram, but color the bars by the treatment

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

-   You can see that the total height of the bars stayed the same
-   That's because ggplot has just colored the pieces of each bar that correspond to each treatment
-   It does this because the default `position` for `geom_histogram` is `"stacked"`, which stacks the bars on top of one another and therefore makes a stacked histogram.
-   If we want separate overlapping histograms then we need to change the position

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, position = "identity")
```

-   And then add some transparency so we can see all of the histograms

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, position = "identity", alpha = 0.5)
```

### Layers

-   So far we've only plotted one layer or geom at a time, but we can combine multiple layers in a single plot
    -   `ggplot()` sets defaults for all layers
    -   Can combine multiple layers using `+`
    -   The first geom is plotted first and then additional geoms are layered on top
-   Combine different kinds of layers
-   Add a linear model

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   Both the `geom_point` layer and the `geom_smooth` layer use the defaults form `ggplot`

-   Both use `acacia` for data and `x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT` for the aesthetic

-   `geom_smooth` uses the statistical transformation `stat_smooth()` to produce a smoothed representation of the data

-   Do this by treatment

```{r}
ggplot(acacia, aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   Because the color aesthetic is the default it is inherited by geom_smooth
-   One set of points and one model for each treatment

### Changing values across layers

-   We can also plot data from different columns or even data frames on the same graph
-   To do this we need to better understand how layers and defaults work
-   So far we've put all of the information on data and aesthetic mapping into `ggplot()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   This sets the default data frame and aesthetic, which is then used by `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`
-   Alternatively instead of setting the default we could just give these values directly to `geom_point()` and \`geom_smo

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = acacia,
             mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT,
                           color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   We can see that this information is no longer shared with other geoms since it is no longer the default, so we've asked for a smooth of nothing and so no smoother is shown

-   Can use this combine different aesthetics

-   Make a single model across all treatments while still coloring points

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = acacia,
             mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT,
                           color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_smooth(data = acacia,
              mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT))
```

-   `color` is only set in the aesthethic for the point layer

-   So the smooth layer is made across all x and y values

-   *Check if this makes sense to everyone*

-   This same sort of change can be used to plot different columns on the same plot by changing the values of x or y

-   If we wanted to plot two different columns as Y we could change the value of y in the aesthetic

-   If we wanted to use data from two different data frames we could change the value of data

-   We can also keep all of the values that are shared as defaults if we want to

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = HEIGHT)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Understanding defaults (optional if students struggling after exercise)

-   Let's move some things around to help understand where to put different information data and mapping

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = AXIS1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   What happens if we move `data` and `mapping` to one layer

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = AXIS1)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   What about the other layer

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = AXIS1), method = "lm")
```

-   What if we move one to each layer (error)

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = acacia) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = CIRC, y = AXIS1), method = "lm")
```

-   So, each geom needs access to `data` and `mapping`
-   If they are not in the geom then the geom uses the defaults `ggplot()`
-   If we want different `data` or `mapping` for different layers then provide different values to different geoms

```{r}
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = CIRC)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = AXIS1), color = "black") +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = AXIS2), color = "grey")
```

### Grammar of graphics

-   Uniquely describe any plot based on a defined set of information
-   Leland Wilkinson
-   Geometric object(s)
    -   Data
    -   Mapping
    -   Statistical transformation
    -   Position (allows you to shift objects, e.g., spread out overlapping data points)
-   Facets
-   Coordinates (coordinate systems other than cartesian, also allows zooming)

### Saving plots as new files

```{r}
ggsave("acacia_by_treatment.jpg")
```

-   The type of the file is determined by the file extension

```{r}
ggsave("acacia_by_treatment.pdf")
```

-   Lots of optional arguments including size

```{r}
ggsave("acacia_by_treatment.pdf", height = 5, width = 5)
```
