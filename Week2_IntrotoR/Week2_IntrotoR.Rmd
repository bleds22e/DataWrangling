### Logging into Posit Cloud

-   Open a browser
-   Go to <https://posit.cloud/>
-   ...

### R

-   Programming language
-   Started as a statistics and data analysis environment
-   But can also build websites, run simulations, and lots of other things
-   R is what runs all of the code we will write this semester
-   Separate from RStudio

### RStudio

-   IDE - Integrated Development Environment
-   Makes developing code in R easier by including a number of tools in one place
-   Interpreter/Console is where R is actually running
    -   Can work in here "interactively"
    -   Run a single command and see the result
    -   `2 + 2`
    -   This is also where RStudio will run code written in the text editor
-   Text editor
    -   Where we write code we want to keep and potentially reuse later
    -   Creates a plain text file that stores the code we've written
    -   We can open it by clicking the `New File` button or using the `Ctrl-Shift-N` keyboard shortcut (`Cmd-Shift-N`) on Mac

### Posit Cloud

-   An online version of RStudio that runs in your browser
-   We're using it because it:
    1.  Avoids installation difficulties
    2.  Makes sharing code with instructors for debugging easier
    3.  Let's us leave some of the complexities of working with R until after we've learned the basics
-   Folks with limited internet access, please checkout the video on working with RStudio installed on your own computer

#### Posit Cloud in Class

-   All work for this class will be done in a class workspace
-   To join this space follow the link provided via Canvas and sign in using your UF email address
-   When you open Posit Cloud click on the three lines in the top corner and select `Data Carpentry` from `Spaces`
-   Click on the appropriate week, which should say `Start` by it the first time you open it
-   This is your own copy of the assignment, which should include everything you need to both follow along with the lessons and complete the assignment
-   This is also where we can come look at your code to help if you get stuck
-   If you want to start a separate project, not for class, just click on `New Project` instead

### Basic expressions

-   *Write code directly in the text editor*
-   Kangaroo rat weight (g -\> lb)

```{r}
50 / 1000 * 2.2
```

-   This is called an expression

-   A set of commands that returns a value

-   Run line

-   Run selection

-   `Source` & `Source with Echo`

-   Save as `krat_weight_analysis.R`

-   Can see in the `Files` tab that we've created this file

-   We can also use this tab to create, delete, and rename files & folders

### Variables

-   To save the values we calculate for later use we use variables
-   A variable is a name that has a value associated with it
    -   Assign using `<-` or `=`

```{r}
weight_g <- 50
weight_g = 50
```

-   We can see that this variable has been created by looking in the Environment tab

-   It works just like the value itself

```{r}
weight_g / 1000
weight_g / 1000 * 2.2
weight_lb <- weight_g / 1000 * 2.2
```

-   It won't change unless you assign a new value to it directly

```{r}
weight_g
weight_g * 2
weight_g
weight_g <- 26
weight_g
```

### RStudio tips

-   `tab` key autocompletes
    -   *Type `wei` and then tab*
    -   Let the computer do repetitious work.
    -   It's easier and with fewer mistakes.
-   And a history of the commands you've run under `History` in case you forgot to write something down

### Comments

-   Remember what code is doing
-   For humans, not computers
-   Use the `#`

```{r}
# Calculate weight of Kangaroo Rat in pounds
```

### Assignments format

-   Comment before each problem and each sub-problem
-   Make sure result prints out on `Source with echo`

```{r}
# Exercise 1

# 1.1
2 + 2

# 1.2
2 - 8
```

-   Now we're going to work on some exercises to get a feel for this
-   In class we will often only do part of an exercise and save the rest for later

Do Exercises 1 and 2 in the Assignment.

### Functions

-   A function is a complicated expression.
-   Command that returns a value

```{r}
sqrt(49)
```

-   A function call is composed of two parts.
    -   Name of the function
    -   Arguments that the function requires to calculate the value it returns.
    -   `sqrt()` is the name of the function, and `49` is the argument.
-   We can also pass variables as the argument

```{r}
weight_lb <- 0.11
sqrt(weight_lb)
```

-   Another function that we'll use a lot is `str()`
-   All values and therefore all variables have types
-   `str`, short for "structure", lets us look at them

```{r}
str(weight_lb)
```

-   Another data type is for text data
-   We write text inside of quotation makes

```{r}
"hello world"
```

-   If we look at the structure of some text we see that it is type character

```{r}
str("hello world")
```

-   Functions can take multiple arguments.
    -   Round `weight_lb` to one decimal place
    -   Typing `round()` shows there are two arguments
    -   Number to be rounded and number of digits

```{r}
round(weight_lb, 1)
```

-   Functions return values, so as with other values and expressions, if we don't save the output of a function then there is no way to access it later
-   It is common to forget this when dealing with functions and expect the function to have changed the value of the variable
-   But looking at `weight_lb` we see that it hasn't been rounded

```{r}
weight_lb
```

-   To save the output of a function we assign it to a variable.

```{r}
weight_rounded <- round(weight_lb, 1)
weight_rounded
```
