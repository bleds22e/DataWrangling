### 2. Portal Data Aggregation (15 pts)

```{r}

# 1. Use the group_by() and summarize() functions to get a count of the number of individuals in each species ID.
print("2a")
surveys %>% 
  group_by(species_id) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())


# 2. Use the group_by() and summarize() functions to get a count of the number of individuals in each species ID in each year.
print("2b")
surveys %>% 
  group_by(species_id, year) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())

# 3. Use the filter(), group_by(), and summarize() functions to get the mean mass of species DO in each year.
 print("2c")
 surveys %>%
  filter(species_id == "DO") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))

```

### 3. Shrub Volume Aggregation (15 pts)


```{r message=FALSE}
shrub_dims <- read_csv('shrub-volume-data.csv')
shrub_dims %>% 
  group_by(experiment) %>% 
  summarize(avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_height = max(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### 4. Portal Data Joins (25 pts)

```{r}
# 1.
print("4a")
inner_join(surveys, species, by = "species_id")

# 2.
print("4b")
inner_join(surveys, species, by = "species_id") %>% 
inner_join(., plots, by = "plot_id")

# 3.
print("4c")
surveys %>% 
  inner_join(plots, by = "plot_id") %>% 
  filter(plot_type == "Control")
```

### 5. Portal Data `dplyr` Review (25 pts)

```{r}
print("5a")

  inner_join(species, by = "species_id") %>% 
  inner_join(plots, by = "plot_id") %>% 
  filter(plot_type == "Control" | plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure") %>% 
  filter(taxa == "Rodent") %>% 
  select('year', 'genus', 'species', 'weight', 'plot_type') %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight))

print("5b")
surveys %>% 
  inner_join(species, by = "species_id") %>% 
  inner_join(plots, by = "plot_id") %>% 
  filter(plot_type == "Control" | plot_type == "Long-term Krat Exclosure",
         taxa == "Rodent", 
         !is.na(weight)) %>% 
  select('year', 'genus', 'species', 'weight', 'plot_type') %>% 
  group_by(year, plot_type) |> 
  summarize(min_weight = min(weight),
            max_weight = max(weight),
            mean_weight = mean(weight))
```


### 6. Shrub Volume Bind (10 pts)


```{r}
new_data <- data.frame(respiratory_rate = c(2.2, 4.0, 6.1, 2.3, 4.1, 6.2, 1.8, 3.5, 5.7, 1.9, 3.5, 5.8, 2.0, 4.7, 6.2),
                       average_temp_C = c(15.1, 20.2, 24.7, 15.2, 22.0, 25.1, 14.2, 19.0, 23.6, 14.9, 20.3, 24.1, 19.2, 22.7, 25.0))

```

```{r}
bind_cols(shrub_dims, new_data)

### 7. Shrub Volume Join (15 pts)

```{r message=FALSE}
experiments <- read_csv("https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/data/shrub-volume-experiments.csv")
sites <- read_csv("https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/data/shrub-volume-sites.csv")
```


```{r}

# 1. Import the experiments data and then use `inner_join` to combine
print("7a")
inner_join(shrub_dims, experiments, by = "experiment")

# 2. Import the sites data and the combine it with both the data on shrub
# dimensions and the data on experiments to produce a single data frame
# that contains all of the data.
print("7b")
shrub_dims_experiments <- inner_join(shrub_dims, experiments, by = "experiment")
shrub_data <- inner_join(shrub_dims_experiments, sites, by = "site")
